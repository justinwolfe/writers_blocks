A text drafting tool so minimalist that the words you write are invisible

I often hate the way that I write.  That's why I made this thing, a web text editor that replaces each word you type with a block of light.  Use it, as I do, for times when you want or need to write but you don't want to be reminded of how terrible you are every time you look at the screen.  If you're not as full of constant self-hatred as I am, it's also great for banging out a rough draft of something without feeling compelled to start editing it before you're finished (you can even disable the backspace key).  If you're using it for a daily writing practice (I use it for my journal), you can set a target word count for each session and see a visual indicator of your progress towards your goal as the background gradually shifts from one color to another (you can also receive a pop-up notification when you finally hit the target).  There are small distractions/inspirations to look at if you get stuck (random words and definitions, couplets from Shakespeare's sonnets, Oblique Strategies) and the output features allow you to email your text or save it to your hard drive without even having to look at it once.
